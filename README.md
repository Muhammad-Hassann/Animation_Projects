# GSAP ScrollTrigger Animation with Canvas

This project creates a scroll-based animation using GSAP's ScrollTrigger and an HTML5 canvas element. As the user scrolls, a sequence of images is displayed on the canvas, simulating an animation.

## Project Structure

- HTML: Contains a canvas element for rendering images.
- CSS: Styles the canvas to be sticky and responsive, ensuring it fills the viewport during scrolling.
- JavaScript: Handles image preloading, scaling, and the scroll-triggered animation using GSAP.

## Key Components

1. Preloading Images: Loads a sequence of images into an array.
2. Loading Images: Draws the current image on the canvas, scaled to fit the viewport.
3. Starting the Animation: Uses GSAPâ€™s ScrollTrigger to animate through the image sequence as the user scrolls.

## Dependencies
- GSAP: For creating animations.
- ScrollTrigger: A GSAP plugin to control the animation based on scroll position.
